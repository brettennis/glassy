# Glassy

Glassy is a simple surf forecast app.

All weather data is sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) 
via the [Stormglass weather API](https://stormglass.io/), and the app is built with the [React framework](https://react.dev/).

The app currently supports forecasts for a single location, the Surf City Ocean Pier on Topsail Beach, NC.
